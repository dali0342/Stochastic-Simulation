# Epidemic modeling with stochastic simulation
This program was developed by Ida Hellqvist and David Lide for the course Numerical Methods and Simulation at Uppsala University (1TD403, 5 credits). This program implements and studies some well known models as well as a further development of our own model for disease transmission.

## Models
The models that has been implemented are SIR, SEIR, SEIRD and SEIRDV.

The equations are modeled for a time span of 120 days, and a population of 1 000 individuals where 5 are infected.
